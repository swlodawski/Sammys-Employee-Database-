# Employee Database
I was asked to create an employee database that would store employee, role and department data. I was also asked to allow for the creation of new roles, departments and addition of new employees.

## Installation

In this application I used node, pg and inquirer packages as well as JavaScript.

To install the required package's run npm i in the terminal.

## Usage
Upon interaction the user will be prompted with several options:
1. View:
 1. All Departments
 2. All Roles
 3. All Employees.
2. Add:
 1. Department
 2. Role
 3. New Employee
```
